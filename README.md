# README
This repository holds HAWKS config files (and related experiment scripts) defining published experiments for public reference, enabling reproduction of results.

If you have issues with using the `hawks` library itself, please raise an issue on the [HAWKS repo](https://github.com/sea-shunned/hawks).

If there are issues with any results, or for other questions or potential collaborations, please [contact me](mailto:c.shand@ucl.ac.uk).
